# Decision Framework: Systems-Level Thinking

## Before Any Implementation Decision

### **Step 1: Understand the Complete Context**
1. **What is the end goal?** (competition submission, research, etc.)
2. **What are all the requirements?** (functional, technical, competition)
3. **What are the constraints?** (memory, time, data, etc.)
4. **How does this fit into the complete workflow?**

### **Step 2: Map Dependencies**
1. **What components does this affect?**
2. **What components affect this?**
3. **What are the cross-dependencies?**
4. **What are the failure modes?**

### **Step 3: Design for the Whole System**
1. **Does this solution work across the entire pipeline?**
2. **Does this meet all requirements?**
3. **Does this handle all constraints?**
4. **Can this be validated and tested?**

### **Step 4: Plan Validation Strategy**
1. **How will we test this works end-to-end?**
2. **What are the validation checkpoints?**
3. **How will we catch issues early?**
4. **What are the recovery procedures?**

## Decision Checklist

### **Before Starting Any Work:**
- [ ] **Have I mapped the complete workflow?**
- [ ] **Do I understand all requirements and constraints?**
- [ ] **Have I identified all dependencies?**
- [ ] **Have I planned the validation strategy?**
- [ ] **Does this solution work for the whole system?**

### **Before Implementing Any Solution:**
- [ ] **Does this meet the end goal?**
- [ ] **Does this work with other components?**
- [ ] **Does this handle real-world constraints?**
- [ ] **Can this be tested and validated?**
- [ ] **What are the failure modes and recovery?**

### **Before Scaling Up:**
- [ ] **Have I tested with small subsets?**
- [ ] **Have I validated the complete workflow?**
- [ ] **Have I identified potential bottlenecks?**
- [ ] **Have I planned for edge cases?**

## Example: The NTC Issue

### **What I Should Have Done:**

#### **Step 1: Understand Complete Context**
- **End goal:** Valid competition submission that passes cell-eval prep
- **Requirements:** Must include NTC cells, correct format, all genes
- **Constraints:** Memory efficient, scalable, reproducible
- **Workflow:** Training → Model → Predictions → Submission → Validation → Competition

#### **Step 2: Map Dependencies**
- **Training data** → NTC cells available
- **Model architecture** → Prediction format
- **Submission format** → cell-eval requirements
- **Memory constraints** → Batch processing strategy

#### **Step 3: Design for Whole System**
- **Include NTC cells during submission creation** (not post-hoc)
- **Design submission format to meet cell-eval requirements**
- **Use memory-efficient batch processing**
- **Validate at each step**

#### **Step 4: Plan Validation Strategy**
- **Test with small subsets first**
- **Validate submission format before cell-eval prep**
- **Check all requirements are met**
- **Plan recovery for failures**

### **What I Actually Did:**
- ❌ **Focused on technical optimization** (batch processing)
- ❌ **Ignored competition requirements** (NTC cells needed)
- ❌ **Didn't test complete workflow**
- ❌ **Created solution that didn't meet requirements**

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### **1. Solution-First Thinking**
- ❌ "I need to optimize memory usage" → implement batch processing
- ✅ "I need a valid submission" → design complete workflow

### **2. Component Isolation**
- ❌ "This component works in isolation"
- ✅ "This component works with the complete system"

### **3. Late Validation**
- ❌ "I'll test it when it's done"
- ✅ "I'll test it at each step"

### **4. Requirements Blindness**
- ❌ "This is technically elegant"
- ✅ "This meets all requirements"

## Practical Application

### **For Any New Feature:**
1. **Start with the end goal**
2. **Map the complete workflow**
3. **Identify all requirements and constraints**
4. **Design for the whole system**
5. **Plan validation strategy**
6. **Test with small subsets first**

### **For Any Bug Fix:**
1. **Understand the root cause** (not just symptoms)
2. **Map how it affects the complete system**
3. **Design a fix that works across components**
4. **Test the complete workflow**
5. **Validate against all requirements**

### **For Any Optimization:**
1. **Identify the bottleneck in the complete workflow**
2. **Understand the trade-offs across components**
3. **Design optimization that benefits the whole system**
4. **Test that it doesn't break other components**
5. **Validate that it still meets all requirements**
