# Virtual Cell Challenge: Complete System Design

## Overview
This document defines the complete end-to-end system for the Virtual Cell Challenge, ensuring all components work together to meet competition requirements.

## System Architecture

### 1. **Data Pipeline**
```
Raw Data → Preprocessing → Training Set → Validation Set
    ↓
Gene Selection → Feature Engineering → Baseline Calculation
```

### 2. **Training Pipeline**
```
Training Data → Model Architecture → Training → Validation → Model Checkpoint
    ↓
Model Evaluation → Performance Metrics → Model Selection
```

### 3. **Submission Pipeline**
```
Trained Model → Prediction Generation → Submission Format → Validation → Competition
    ↓
NTC Integration → Gene Mapping → File Format → cell-eval prep
```

## Critical Requirements & Constraints

### **Competition Requirements**
- [ ] Submission must be in `.h5ad` format
- [ ] Must contain exactly 18,080 genes (or subset for testing)
- [ ] Must include non-targeting control (NTC) cells
- [ ] Total cells ≤ 100,000
- [ ] Must pass cell-eval prep validation

### **Technical Constraints**
- [ ] Memory efficient (handle large datasets)
- [ ] Scalable (work with full gene set)
- [ ] Reproducible (consistent results)
- [ ] Fast (reasonable training and inference times)

### **Cross-Dependencies**
- [ ] Training gene selection affects submission gene mapping
- [ ] Model architecture affects prediction format
- [ ] Memory constraints affect batch processing strategy
- [ ] Competition rules affect validation requirements

## End-to-End Workflow Design

### **Phase 1: Data Preparation**
1. **Load and validate training data**
2. **Select highly variable genes** (for model efficiency)
3. **Calculate NTC baseline** (for unmodeled genes)
4. **Prepare validation perturbation list**

### **Phase 2: Model Training**
1. **Design model architecture** (considering submission requirements)
2. **Train with selected genes** (memory efficient)
3. **Validate performance** (ensure quality)
4. **Save model and metadata** (gene list, architecture, etc.)

### **Phase 3: Submission Generation**
1. **Load trained model and metadata**
2. **Generate predictions for all perturbations**
3. **Map predictions to full gene set**
4. **Include NTC cells** (from training data)
5. **Create submission file** (correct format)
6. **Validate submission** (before cell-eval prep)

### **Phase 4: Competition Submission**
1. **Run cell-eval prep** (final validation)
2. **Generate competition file** (.vcc format)
3. **Submit to competition**

## Design Principles

### **1. Requirements-First Design**
- Start with competition requirements
- Design backwards from submission format
- Ensure all components support final goal

### **2. Cross-Component Validation**
- Every component must work with others
- Test complete workflows, not just individual parts
- Validate at system boundaries

### **3. Memory-Aware Design**
- Consider memory constraints at every step
- Use efficient data structures and algorithms
- Plan for scalability from the start

### **4. Error Prevention**
- Build validation into every step
- Test with small subsets first
- Fail fast and clearly

## Implementation Strategy

### **Step 1: System Validation**
1. **Create minimal working example** (small dataset)
2. **Test complete workflow** (data → training → submission)
3. **Validate against competition requirements**
4. **Document any gaps or issues**

### **Step 2: Scale Up**
1. **Apply to larger datasets** (more genes, more cells)
2. **Optimize for performance** (memory, speed)
3. **Maintain validation** at each scale
4. **Test edge cases** (large perturbations, etc.)

### **Step 3: Production Ready**
1. **Full dataset processing**
2. **Robust error handling**
3. **Comprehensive validation**
4. **Documentation and reproducibility**

## Validation Framework

### **At Each Step:**
1. **Does this work with the complete system?**
2. **Does this meet competition requirements?**
3. **Does this handle real-world constraints?**
4. **Can this be validated and tested?**

### **Before Any Implementation:**
1. **Map the complete workflow**
2. **Identify all requirements and constraints**
3. **Design for the whole system**
4. **Plan validation strategy**

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### **1. Silo Thinking**
- ❌ Optimizing individual components in isolation
- ✅ Designing for the complete workflow

### **2. Requirements Blindness**
- ❌ Focusing on technical implementation over requirements
- ✅ Starting with requirements and working backwards

### **3. Late Validation**
- ❌ Building everything then testing at the end
- ✅ Validating at each step with small tests

### **4. Memory Ignorance**
- ❌ Assuming unlimited memory resources
- ✅ Designing for memory constraints from the start
